# Grafana data source plugin template

This template is a starting point for building a Data Source Plugin for Grafana.

## What are Grafana data source plugins?

Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, MySQL, and even Datadog. There’s a good chance you can already visualize metrics from the systems you have set up. In some cases, though, you already have an in-house metrics solution that you’d like to add to your Grafana dashboards. Grafana Data Source Plugins enables integrating such solutions with Grafana.

## Getting started

Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Build plugin in development mode and run in watch mode

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
Start Grafana:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
